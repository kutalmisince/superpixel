# superpixel
A family of clustering-based super pixel extraction methods

Superpixel class includes options:
  - Hexagonal, square and iSquare tiling
  - L2 and Bayesian costs for spatial and spectral distances
  - Adjustable superpixel size and compactness
 
 Generated SPs are always connected preserving the initial topology
 Number of SPs is controllable
